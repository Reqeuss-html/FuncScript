## What is FuncScript?

FuncScript is a lightweight scripting language designed to be embedded directly into HTML pages via a custom `<fscript>` tag.

It allows you to write scripts with a simple and readable syntax, inspired by Scratch, that runs in the browser.

You can create and manipulate HTML elements, and apply styles, without writing raw JavaScript.

## How to use FuncScript?

1. Include the FuncScript library in the `<head>` section of your HTML page:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Reqeuss-html/FuncScript@33a076b84320efd485f6a52b72680edd5a48b131/javascript/funcscript/release/funcscript-v0.1.js"></script>
```

Write your FuncScript code in an <fscript> tag anywhere in the body of the document:

```html
<fscript>
create div title "Welcome!"
setStyle title "fontSize" "36px"
setStyle title "textAlign" "center"
</fscript>
```

The script will run automatically when the page loads, creating the elements and applying the styles.
